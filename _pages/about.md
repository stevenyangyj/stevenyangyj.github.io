I am a research scientist at Tencent Game AI. My research interests are in reinforcement learning, machine learning, and LLM/VLM based AI Agents. I have published multiple papers at top-tier AI/ML venues such as ICML, ICLR, CVPR, IJCAI, etc.

My recent research focuses on training generalist AI agents in complex environments through reinforcement and imitation learning, leveraging the rich prior knowledge from pretrained foundation models such as LLMs, VLMs, and video generation models. A highlight of my recent work has been featured by [MIT Technology Review China](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/13249).

I earned my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/computer-science) from the [University of Technology Sydney (UTS)](https://www.uts.edu.au/), where I was an active member of the research group led by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chengqi.Zhang). During my academic journey, I have closely collaborated with [Prof. Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/) from the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/). 
I gained valuable industry experience as a research intern at JD Explore Academy, under the mentorship of [Prof. Li Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/mathshenli/home) from Sun Yat-sen University, and within the team led by [Prof. Xiaodong He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W5WbqgoAAAAJ&hl=en). I also contributed to the development of advanced text/audio-to-video generation models as a research intern at [Tencent Hunyuan](https://hunyuan.tencent.com/), working under the guidance of [Dr. Wei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjxoEpIAAAAJ&hl=en). You are welcome to see more details in my CV: [English](../assets/cv_yijun.pdf) and [中文](../assets/杨一君-cv-含联系信息.pdf).
