# A Brief Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Project description
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made great achievements since proposed. The RL problem involves an agent interacting with an unknown or dynamic environment by executing a sequence of actions and learning from the observations and rewards received. In this project, we will examine how deep learning has been applied to the general decision-making problems in computer game playing, the challenges faced, and how they can be overcome. This project will implement the DRL models by starting with Deep-Q Learning (DQN) written in Python. More game environments from Gym or Mujoco could be chosen by interests.
